FitnessForge is a comprehensive fitness tracking application designed to help users monitor and manage their workouts, track progress over time, and achieve their fitness goals. The project integrates various features, including workout logging, personalized fitness data visualization, and performance analysis. It provides users with a rich, interactive interface that makes fitness management intuitive and effective.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication and Profile Management**
   - **User Registration & Login**: Secure registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
   - **Profile Management**: Users can update and manage their personal information, including profile picture, age, height, weight, and other fitness-related data.
   - **BMI Calculation & Category Display**: Automatic calculation and display of BMI (Body Mass Index) with real-time category updates based on user weight and height.
   - **Ideal Weight Calculation**: Uses the Miller formula to calculate the user’s ideal weight based on height and gender, and displays the ideal weight alongside the current weight.

### 2. **Workout Management**
   - **Workout Logging**: Users can log their workouts with specific details such as type of workout, target muscles, and date/time of the session.
   - **Dynamic Workout Calendar**: A calendar view that displays daily workout logs with color-coded indicators based on workout type. Users can click on each day to view detailed workout logs.
   - **Muscle Group & Workout Type Tracking**: Users can view their workout distribution across different muscle groups and workout types using interactive visualizations.

### 3. **Dashboard with Data Visualizations**
   - **Weight Line Chart**: Displays the user's weight change over time using a line chart. The chart includes both actual weight and ideal weight as reference lines.
   - **Muscle Group and Workout Type Donut Chart**: A dynamic donut chart that displays the proportion of workouts per muscle group or workout type. Users can toggle between muscle groups and workout types to view different aspects of their fitness routines.
   - **BMI and Ideal Weight Indicators**: Displays key health indicators such as BMI category, ideal weight, and current BMI score for easy tracking.

### 4. **Fitness Journals & History Tracking**
   - **Journal Page**: A dedicated journal section where users can see their workout history in a structured format. Users can navigate through different months and view specific workouts logged on each day.
   - **Log and Filter Workouts**: Users can filter workouts by date, muscle group, or workout type to analyze specific segments of their fitness journey.

### 5. **Interactive Charts & Graphs**
   - **Weight Progress Chart**: An interactive line chart that tracks the user’s weight progression over time, making it easy to visualize changes.
   - **Muscle Group Donut Chart**: An interactive chart showing the breakdown of muscle groups targeted during workouts, providing insights into workout balance.
   - **Toggle View Button for Workout Types**: Allows users to switch between muscle group and workout type views in the chart, making it easy to analyze workout patterns.

### 6. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
   - **Intuitive Interface**: All components, from the dashboard to the journal page, are optimized for ease of use with clear navigation and visually appealing elements.
   - **Real-time Updates**: Profile and workout changes are reflected in real-time across all relevant components, ensuring data consistency and up-to-date visuals.

## Technical Stack
